X get current symbol to go to definition

		X remove all references of the updated document (verify if this is working)
		X new added rules/functions are being detected

X suggest "All references" not just "Definitions"

X update all reference when workspace is loaded/extension is inited

X remove example code that is no longer needed 

X Trying to "go to Definition" over a definition is showings references instead (this is vscode standard behaviour)

X Fix Symbol not being detected correclty when a selection exists

X Detect file or folder structure changes and update references:
	X file is:

		X added to existing hierarchy
		X relocated in workspace hierarchy
		X removed from workspace
	X folder is:
		X renamed
		X added with new XML inside
		X relocated in workspace hierarchy
		X removed from workspace
	
	X all above operations need to be tested with shurtcuts (crl+c, ctrl+v, drag and drop, etc)
